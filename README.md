# Enhancing-Road-Safety-by-Predicting-Grey-Spots-Using-Spatial-Analysis
##### The lives of almost 1.3 million people are cut short annually as a result of traffic accidents. There are an additional 20â€“50 million people who sustain non-fatal injuries, many of whom go on to develop disabilities. Road traffic accidents result in significant economic damage for victims and their families. These days predicting road accidents is essential. This can be done by identifying the grey spots, which are locations on roads that are left unaddressed and could become black spots (areas with fatal accidents). In this project, satellite images are collected and ArcGIS software is used to perform spatial analysis  to gain deeper insights from the images. A hybrid model Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is proposed to perform spatial analysis to identify the hidden patterns that are represented using Geographic Information System (GIS). The model helps to reduce the road accidents at different scales and enhance road safety.
